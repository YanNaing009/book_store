INSERT INTO `books` VALUES (1,'Elon Musk','Walter Isaacson','At various moments in “Elon Musk,” Walter Isaacson’s new biography of the world’s richest person, the author tries to make sense of the billionaire entrepreneur he has shadowed for two years — sitting in on meetings, getting a peek at emails and texts, engaging in “scores of interviews and late-night conversations.” Musk is a mercurial “man-child,” Isaacson writes, who was bullied relentlessly as a kid in South Africa until he grew big enough to beat up his bullies. Musk talks about having Asperger’s, which makes him “bad at picking up social cues.” As the people closest to him will attest, he lacks empathy — something that Isaacson describes as a “gene” that’s “hard-wired.”Yet even as Musk struggles to relate to the actual humans around him, his plans for humanity are grand. “A fully reusable rocket is the difference between being a single-planet civilization and being a multiplanet one”: Musk would “maniacally” repeat this message to his staff at SpaceX, his spacecraft and satellite company, where every desion is motivated by his determination to get earthlings to Mars. He pushes employees at his companies — he now runs six, including X, the platform formerly known as Twitter — to slash costs and meet brutal deadlines because he needs to pour resources into the moonshot of colonizing space “before civilization crumbles.” Disaster could come from climate change, from declining birthrates, from artificial intelligence. Isaacson describes Musk stalking the factory floor of Tesla, his electric car company, issuing orders on the fly. “If I don’t make decisions,” Musk explained, “we die.”By “we,” Musk presumably meant Tesla in that instance. But Musk likes to speak of his business interests in superhero terms, so it’s sometimes hard to be sure. Isaacson, whose previous biographical subjects include Leonardo da Vinci and Steve Jobs, is a patient chronicler of obsession; in the case of Musk, he can occasionally seem too patient — a hazard for any biographer who is given extraordinary access. At one point, Isaacson ass why Musk is so offended by anything he deems politically correct, and Musk, as usual, has to dial it up to 11. “Unless the woke-mind virus, which is fundamentally anti-science, anti-merit and anti-human in general, is stopped,” he declares, “civilization will never become multiplanetary.” There are a number of curious assertions in that sentence, but it would have been nice if Isaacson had pushed him to answer a basic question: What on earth does any of it even mean?',15.65,4.5,'2023-09-12','https://image.ebooks.com/cover/210769655.jpg','active','Biography'),(2,'Never Let Me Go update','Kazuo Ishiguro','																																																																Hailsham seems like a pleasant English boarding school, far from the influences of the city.

Dumbledore enlists Harry?s help, to convince his old friend and retired professor Horace Slughorn to return to his old teaching post at Hogwarts. He succeeds and Professor Slughorn begins the term at Hogwarts teaching potions, with Severus Snape now the Defence of Dark Arts teacher, the job he has so long hankered after. Harry is lent a potions book by Professor Slughorn, which Harry finds a number of notes from it\'s previous owner, which allow Harry to excel in a subject he has never been more than average at. The book is marked \"Property of the Half-Blood Prince\". Things do not appear to be as they should to Harry; he overhears Malfoy, who he sees entering a shop dealing in dark arts artefacts and then threatening the shop keeper about an item he wants repairing and another that needs to be kept safe. Snape also seems up to no good but Harry is frustrated at Dumbledore?s seemingly disinterest in Harry?s fears that they both maybe in league with the Death Eaters. As Voldemort gathers strength Dumbledore must prepare Harry for what is to come and looks to past to help find clues that may help them in the fight against the Dark Lord. Not only must Harry now conquer his fear but also his feelings for someone very close to him. The battle against Voldemort continues but can it be a happy ending?\r\n\r\nThis is my absolute favourite book of the entire series. It?s so dark in places, in fact quite creepy, but the flashbacks to the past in which we learn so much about Voldemort or should I say Tom Riddle are absolute absorbing. Everything seems to be at risk here and you just don?t know what will happen next, nothing and no one seems to be safe anymore. There is also a touch of romance, and not just for Harry, which helps to lighten things, but the tension in this book is palpable and it really isn?t one you can put down. It?s a hefty book but I managed it over a weekend and was left wanting more. There are so many plot lines in this one and the thumping pace does not let up from first page to last.

From the very beginning until the end J.K. Rowling has me gripped! There is never a dull moment, whether it\'s battling with trolls, a three-headed dog, or Harry facing Lord Voldermort. I would definitely recommend this book because it keeps you reading without ever wanting to put the book down. By the end of the book you come to love the characters and you want to read more.

Four legendary players. One unforgettable season.\r\n\r\nThe 1980s were a transformative decade for the NBA. Since its founding in 1946, the league had evolved from a bruising, earthbound game of mostly nameless, underpaid players to one in which athletes became household names for their thrilling, physics-defying play. The 1987�88 season was the peak of that golden era, a year of incredible drama that featured a pantheon of superstars in their prime�the most future Hall of Famers competing at one time in any given season�battling for the title, and for their respective legacies.\r\n\r\nIn When the Game Was War, bestselling author Rich Cohen tells the story of this incredible season through the four teams, and the four players, who dominated Larry Bird and the Boston Celtics, Magic Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers, Isiah Thomas and the Detroit Pistons, and a young Michael Jordan and his Chicago Bulls. From rural Indiana to the South Side of Chicago, suburban North Carolina to rust-belt Michigan, Cohen explores the diverse journeys each of these iconic players took before arriving on the big stage. Drawing from dozens of interviews with NBA insiders, Cohen brings to vivid life some of the most colorful characters of the era�like Bill Laimbeer, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Danny Ainge, and Charles Oakley�who fought like hell to help these stars succeed. \r\n\r\nFor anyone who longs to understand how the NBA came to be the cultural juggernaut it is today�and to relive the magic and turmoil of those pivotal years� When the Game Was War brilliantly recasts one unforgettable season and the four transcendent players who were at the center of it all.								\r\n							',19.35,3.9,'2023-09-05','https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1684815435i/63242149.jpg','active','Sport'),(7,'SPY X FAMILY 2','Tatsuya Endo','								Master spy Twilight is the best at what he does when it comes to going undercover on dangerous missions in the name of a better world.

One phrase in particular anchored itself in listeners� minds, a reminder that for all the discord and struggle to be found in our history as a nation, we have always been guided by a dogged optimism in the future, or what Obama called �the audacity of hope.�\r\n\r\nThe Audacity of Hope  is Barack Obama�s call for a different brand of politics�a politics for those weary of bitter partisanship   and alienated by the �endless clash of armies� we see in congress and on the campaign trail; a politics rooted in the faith, inclusiveness, and nobility of spirit at the heart of �our improbable experiment in democracy.� He explores those forces�from the fear of losing to the perpetual need to raise money to the power of the media�that can stifle even the best-intentioned politician. He also writes, with surprising intimacy and self-deprecating humor, about settling in as a senator, seeking to balance the demands of public service and family life, and his own deepening religious commitment.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of this book is Barack Obama�s vision of how we can move beyond our divisions to tackle concrete problems. He examines the growing economic insecurity of American families, the racial and religious tensions within the body politic, and the transnational threats�from terrorism to pandemic�that gather beyond our shores. And he grapples with the role that faith plays in a democracy�where it is vital and where it must never intrude. Underlying his stories is a vigorous search for connection: the foundation for a radically hopeful political consensus.\r\n\r\nOnly by returning to the principles that gave birth to our Constitution, Obama says, can Americans repair a political process that is broken, and restore to working order a government that has fallen dangerously out of touch with millions of ordinary Americans.

On the way out of the park, his father asked him to make a promise. �Promise me you will never be a Cubs fan. The Cubs do not win,� he explained, �and because of that, a Cubs fan will have a diminished life determined by low expectations. That team will screw up your life.�\r\n\r\nAs a result, Cohen became not just a Cubs fan but one of the biggest Cubs fans in the world.\r\n\r\nIn this book, he captures the story of the team, its players and crazy days. Billy Sunday and Ernie Banks, Three Finger Brown and Ryne Sandberg, Bill Buckner, the Bartman Ball, Kris Bryant, Anthony Rizzo�the early dominance followed by a 107 year trek across the wilderness. It�s all here�not just what happened, but what it felt like and what it meant. He searches for the cause of the famous curse. Was it the billy goat, kicked out of Wrigley Field in Game 5 of the 1945 World Series, or does it go back further, to the very origins of the franchise? Driven mad with futility, he went on the road with the team in search of answers, interviewed great players present and past, researched in libraries but also in the bleachers, double-fisted, a frosty malt in each hand, demanding answers. He came to see the curse as a burden but also as a blessing.\r\n\r\nCubs fans are unique, emissaries from a higher realm, warning of hubris and vanity. The blue cap with the red C said, �My Kingdom is not of this world.� He interviewed the architects of the 2016 Cubs, the team that broke the curse. Here�s what he asked: How the hell did you do it? He was at (almost) every game of the 2016 playoff run�a run that culminated in (maybe) the single greatest baseball game ever played. He was excited but also terrified. Losing is easy. What would it mean to win? Wearing a Yankees hat meant corporate excellence. Wearing a Mets hat meant miracles. But wearing a Cubs hat meant loving the game on its most humdrum afternoon�September 13, 1979, say, 14 games out of first place, Larry Bittner driving in Ivan DeJesus. Would we lose that?

Obama brings readers inside the Oval Office and the White House Situation Room, and to Moscow, Cairo, Beijing, and points beyond. We are privy to his thoughts as he assembles his cabinet, wrestles with a global financial crisis, takes the measure of Vladimir Putin, overcomes seemingly insurmountable odds to secure passage of the Affordable Care Act, clashes with generals about U.S. strategy in Afghanistan, tackles Wall Street reform, responds to the devastating Deepwater Horizon blowout, and authorizes Operation Neptune�s Spear, which leads to the death of Osama bin Laden.\r\n\r\nA Promised Land is extraordinarily intimate and introspective�the story of one man�s bet with history, the faith of a community organizer tested on the world stage. Obama is candid about the balancing act of running for office as a Black American, bearing the expectations of a generation buoyed by messages of �hope and change,� and meeting the moral challenges of high-stakes decision-making. He is frank about the forces that opposed him at home and abroad, open about how living in the White House affected his wife and daughters, and unafraid to reveal self-doubt and disappointment. Yet he never wavers from his belief that inside the great, ongoing American experiment, progress is always possible.\r\n\r\nThis beautifully written and powerful book captures Barack Obama�s conviction that democracy is not a gift from on high but something founded on empathy and common understanding and built together, day by day.								\r\n							',17.99,4.3,'2020-11-17','https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1600357110i/55361205.jpg','active',' Politics History'),(23,'Che: A Revolutionary Life','Jon Lee Anderson','The graphic adaptation of the groundbreaking and definitive biography of Che Guevara\r\n\r\nChe Guevara\'s legend is unmatched in the modern world. Since his assassination in 1967 at the age of thirty-nine, the Argentine revolutionary has become an internationally recognized icon, as revered as he is controversial. As a Marxist ideologue who sought to end global inequality by bringing down the American capitalist empire through armed guerrilla warfare, Che has few rivals in the Cold War era as an apostle of revolutionary change. In Che: A Revolutionary Life, Jon Lee Anderson and Jose Hernandez present the man behind the myth, creating a complex and human portrait of this passionate idealist.\r\n\r\nAdapted from Jon Lee Anderson\'s definitive masterwork, Che vividly transports us from young Ernesto\'s medical school days as a sensitive asthmatic to the battlefields of the Cuban revolution, from his place of power alongside Castro, to his disastrous sojourn in the Congo, and his violent end in Bolivia. Through renowned Mexican artist Jose Hernandez\'s drawings we feel the bullets wing past the head of the young rebel in Cuba, we smell the thick smoke of his and Castro\'s cigars, and scrutinize his proud face as he\'s called \"Comandante\" for the first time. With astonishing precision, color, and drama, Anderson and Hernandez\'s Che makes us a witness to the revolutionary life and times of Che Guevara.								\r\n							',18.99,3.8,'2016-01-01','https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1528378338i/38821041.jpg','active','Biography History  Politics'),(24,'SPY�FAMILY 1','Tatsuya Endo','Master spy Twilight is the best at what he does when it comes to going undercover on dangerous missions in the name of a better world.
